# SSS: Smart Skill Support

SSS is an intelligent, role-aware chatbot system that processes multi-modal inputs (text, audio, images, documents), rephrases content based on user roles, and responds intelligently using LangGraph, Ollama, Whisper, OCR, and Qdrant. 
This application can also support in automating the upskilling or skill training for onboarded resources by curating content based on the userâ€™s skill/role.
